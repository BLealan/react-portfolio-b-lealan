# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a profile to display my work and details, using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), which draws together elements of JavaScript, HTML and CSS!

Each page is broken down to it's own file, which are then brought in via the *Nav.jsx* ad *main.jsx* files which load the corresponding content for the page ending the route. Files within the *components* folder handle page functionality and elements of the page that are consistent across the site. 

I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) to find some nice complimentary colours to use on the site. While some styling has been implemented, it is by no means complete, and I look forward to fine-tuning it with improved design and increased features for the user!

## Installation

If you wish to run from local machine ensure you have cloned the repository from GitHub, then:
* Ensure you open the folder in your terminal and run `npm install` to download and install the dependencies and devdependencies
* Run `npm build` to create the vite functionality
* Run `npm start` to launch onto [localport 3000](http://localhost:3000/)
